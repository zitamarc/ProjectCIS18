Java CIS 18-A project. This project's purpose is that it gives the user a menu that allows them to pick what kinda technology that they would like to purchase. This will make you go through the list and can choose what kinda technology(piece of technology), what kind of shipping that you would like to purchase, along with when you would like to install this piece of technology. After such, this will let you see how much everything cost, the price in taxes and a total price to go along with it. All this program needs to work is just a system that can run a .java file. Some of the slight things that we struggled with is to make every cost add to eachother.
